Ludum Dare #30 Competition Entry
--------------------------------

Adrian Dale 24/08/2014

Ludum Dare is a Game Jam competition. It is run quarterly.
A theme is chosen and participants then have 48hrs to code a game to fit the theme.

For LD#30 the theme was "Connected Worlds"

I therefore chose to go with a "connection" theme and implement the Hex board game,
which involves connecting opposite sides of the playing field with stones of your
colour.
